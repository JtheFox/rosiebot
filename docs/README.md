This is a documentation site designed by myself with [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) for Rosiebot, hosted on GitHub Pages. All commands and their details are stored in `commands.json` and used by the layout builder in `script.js` to create the documentation based on the latest information. This also avoids the redundancy of having to hardcode all the command details in the HTML and allows for easy addition of new commands to the documentation. There is also a bot stats card on the page populated from data received from Rosiebot's API.
